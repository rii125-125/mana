## What's it?
This is a version control tool like Git. It's like Git, but it's not Git. It's a tool that's a little different from traditional version control tools.
Git is convenient, but it often requires a few slightly tedious operations.<br>
For example, staging and committing requires the following two steps:
```bash
# Stage App.java
git add src/App.java
# Think of a commit message for App.java
git commit -m "Change the type of the `world_population` variable from `int` to `long`"
```
Let's solve these tedious operations with mana.
```bash
mn
> Hello mana!
```

## What can it do?
1. Tools that make visualization easy
2. No complex operations whatsoever
3. High-speed processing, high-speed execution
4. Absolutely no pushing to GitHub or similar platforms
